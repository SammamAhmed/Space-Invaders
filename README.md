# Space-Invaders
This is a simple python-based game that allows player to move the spaceship that constantly shoots upwards. Player can score by simply shooting down the enemy ufos. There will be 5 ufos at all time and each time player shots down one, another one spawns at random place. For each 5 score, the ufos speeds up and keeps moving slightly downwards making the game harder. If player crashes with any ufo, the game ends.

#Purpose of making this game
I made this game to test my abilities on building object-orient based programs.
